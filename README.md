# Employee Tracker - First React App 

React starter project that allowed me to master the concepts of "useState hook" and "useEffect hook" in React. I also used tailwind.css and animate.css in the project. I tried to use components effectively, which is the most basic feature of Javascript frameworks.

I used local storage to store the list and I aimed to make this storage as accurate as possible with useEffect.

Please feel free to contact me for any feedback. I'm just starting to learn React and I'm open to all your suggestions. You can find the platforms you can contact me on my profile.

## Features
Here are the main features of this simple application I created to make the learning process effective and reinforce the basics of React.js:

1. Adding and removing employees
2. Listing of employees
3. If no employee has been added, instead of an empty list, add an informative component for a better UX.
4. Check the inputs and display a "Modal" for the error if the required conditions are not met. Error conditions are: entering a salary lower than the minimum wage, entries are empty, employee name is below the minimum character limit
5. Adding the "Clear List" button to the view for user convenience, which is not shown when the employee list is more than 2 people in order not to disrupt the minimal UI view
6. Animations to prevent eye strain from suddenly appearing components
